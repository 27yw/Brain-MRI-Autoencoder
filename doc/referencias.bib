    abstract="In brain image analysis many of the current pipelines are not robust to the presence of lesions which degrades their accuracy and robustness. For example, performance of classic medical image processing operations such as non-linear registration or segmentation rapidly decreases when dealing with lesions. To minimize their impact, some authors have proposed to inpaint these lesions so classic pipelines can be used. However, this requires to manually delineate the regions of interest which is time consuming. In this paper, we propose a deep network that is able to blindly inpaint lesions in brain images automatically allowing current pipelines to robustly operate under pathological conditions. We demonstrate the improved robustness/accuracy in the brain segmentation problem using the SPM12 pipeline with our automatically inpainted images.",

    abstract="In this paper, we present a new tool for white matter lesion segmentation called lesionBrain. Our method is based on a 3-stage strategy including multimodal patch-based segmentation, patch-based regularization of probability map and patch-based error correction using an ensemble of shallow neural networks. Its robustness and accuracy have been evaluated on the MSSEG challenge 2016 datasets. During our validation, the performance obtained by lesionBrain was competitive compared to recent deep learning methods. Moreover, lesionBrain proposes automatic lesion categorization according to location. Finally, complementary information on gray matter atrophy is included in the generated report. LesionBrain follows a software as a service model in full open access.",
